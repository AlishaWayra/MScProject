# Fitting Brownian motion parameters to glioblastoma cell data

## Project Description
This project focused on fitting the drag (beta) and scaling (sigma_mot) parameter from a Brownian motion model to describe the motion of patient-derived glioblastoma cells. This work was motivated by fact that the deep learning based cell tracking algorithm Btrack was not successful in recreating cell lineage trees from time-lapse microscopy images. In the future, the fitted Brownian motion parameters can be used to inform the global motion parameters of Btrack in order to improve its performance in lineage tree construction.
Three parameter estimation approaches were investigated to fit the parameters beta and sigma_mot to a sample of manually tracked cells in Fiji from live-cell imaging.
